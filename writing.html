     <h1> Writing Challenge </h1>





     <p>
     Well what do you know, I am starting a writing challenge! Something came over me one chilly November evening. And so, here it goes! <br /><br /><br />
     </p>








     <h4> Nov 21, 2019 </h4>

     <p>
I am an INFJ. One of my favorite date night ideas is “let’s turn the lights down low and talk about our darkest fears and insecurities”. Either that, or “let’s engage in a 4-hour long conversation about how artificial intelligence will destroy humanity by hijacking our consciousness and exploiting Earth’s resources while accelerating its own computing power, taking over the solar system, the galaxy and the known universe, then creating a brand new universe with intelligent beings in it.”
     </p>
     <p>
For some reason, my attempts to inject musings on the nature of consciousness into water cooler conversations tend to evoke a blank stare; apparently being the weirdest kid around the block propagated into adulthood.
     </p>
     <p>
And then came 2019 and with it, the discovery of Myers-Briggs typology. Turns out I am in good company! With extroverted sensing as inferior function, not only are INFJs put off by loud noises and bright lights, but we also attach little value to facts, trends, and the events around us. That’s why we get painfully bored by gossip and stories of who did what during the weekend. That’s why we prefer to talk about concepts and ideas, the more abstract the better.
    </p>
     <p>
My party survival strategy is to smile, nod, and pretend I’m having a good time, while wondering if anyone else is faking it as well - another INFJ trait. The combination of our two dominant functions, introverted intuition and extroverted feeling, makes us true chameleons as we tune into our environment and switch on our flamboyant persona. This may come across as insincere but the truth is we care about other people’s feelings too much to burden them with our own discomfort. 
    </p>
     <p>
So the game is no longer me against the world. It became a quest to find like-minded people who will not only accept my quirks, but fully relate. And, whose idea of a date night might include drinking coffee at 3 am and debating the what-if’s of the universe.

I have been waiting for this one thing for the longest time. A fruitful conversation that ignited my appetite kept me daydreaming for weeks, only to resolve into… more waiting. I should have known better – diversify the risk, don’t put all your eggs in one basket, the usual common sense. Yet I find myself passively waiting for the glorious inevitable to manifest itself. Except it doesn’t.
     </p>
     <p>
Where did I go wrong? Are my subconscious beliefs sabotaging my dreams? Did that one pity party last week ruin the whole month of thinking positively and envisioning success? None of it. I just forgot to put the car in gear.
     </p>
     <p>
No amount of positive thoughts and affirmations, not even a giant vision board on the back seat, will ever get you to where you want to go, unless you start the car first. You will stray and get sidetracked, correct course and make endless U-turns. But as long as you keep on moving, the miracle of GPS will make sure you arrive at your destination.
    </p>
     <p>
So why have rested on my laurels? Why have I not taken action to meet the glorious inevitable half way? It doesn’t matter, I am starting the engine right now.

    Today is tough. Only the second day into the challenge and I am already struggling, as the monkey brain works extra hard to come up with excuses. It wants the immediate reward of not having to do something new and uncomfortable. 
     </p>
     <p>
 It reminds me of something I read a while ago, about what makes successful people, well, successful. It’s not luck, not talent, not working hard, not even working smart. It’s that they push through the things they don’t feel like doing. Fun fact: those things are usually not that difficult; it’s making that phone call,  putting on the gym clothes, not eating that cookie, or sitting down to write for 30 minutes. Every. Single. Day. No excuses, no whining, no “gee I don’t feel like doing it, I’ll start tomorrow”.
     </p>
     <p>
Discipline is such an under-rated concept these days. Yes, hustling and grinding is all the rage, but the focus tends to shift towards doing something difficult, something that stretches your mental or physical abilities to their limits. Yet the true battle is rarely won (or lost) at the blue ridge marathon finish line. It starts with putting on your running shoes on a cold winter morning. The second day in a row.

       Day one of the writing challenge!
     </p>
     <p>
     I am starting this challenge to write every day for either 30 minutes or 250 words. I’m not sure how much 250 words is, and if it is comparable to the 30 minutes. Might be too much or too little, no idea. Because writing has been super hard for me in the past, I’ve decided to use a technique that is supposed to help with perfectionism. The technique is this: separate out the writing from the editing. It’s that simple! I used to write and edit at the same time, write and rewrite each sentence many times before I thought it was good enough. This was a problem because I spent so much time, producing so little output. It was discouraging.   
     </p>
     <p>
        Now, the only thing I care about initially is getting my thoughts out on the paper. Write as fast as I can, no editing. Forget about style, don’t worry about grammar. Let the sentences be clumsy, I can go back to editing later. And then later on when I am editing, time-box it! Don’t set out to be perfect, just make slight improvements over the initial version, as long as there is time left. This is not a school project nor is it a paid article, nobody is likely to ever read it except me maybe, just out of curiosity. How was my writing when I was just getting started? That’s the ultimate goal, to get better every day.
     </p>
     <p>
        Well, my 250 words is up, until tomorrow! :)
