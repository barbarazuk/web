     <h3> Nov 18, 2019 – Monday </h3>   
     Day one of the writing challenge! I am starting this challenge to write every day for either 30 minutes of 250 words. I’m not sure how much 250 words is, and if it is comparable with the 30 minutes. Might be too much or too little, no idea. Because writing has been super hard for me in the past, I’ve decided to use a technique that is supposed to help with perfectionism. The technique is this: separate out the writing from the editing. It’s that simple! I used to write and edit at the same time, write and rewrite each sentence many times before I thought it was good enough. This was a problem because I spent so much time, producing so little output. It was discouraging. No, the only thing I care about initially is getting my thought out on the paper. Write as fast as I can, no editing. Forget about style, don’t worry about grammar. Let the sentences be clumsy, I’ll go back to editing later. And then later on when I am editing, time box it! Don’t set out to be perfect, just make slight improvements over the initial version, for as long as I have time left. This is not a school project nor is a paid article, nobody is likely to ever read it except me maybe, just out of curiosity. How was my writing when I was just getting started? That’s the ultimate goal, to get better every day. 
        Well, my 250 words is up, until tomorrow.
